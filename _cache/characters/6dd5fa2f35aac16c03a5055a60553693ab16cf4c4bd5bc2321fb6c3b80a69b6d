She has pink hair, straight and reaching past her shoulders. She wears hair accessories like ribbons and clips. She has a beautiful face with bright green eyes.

She has a mole under her left eye. She paints her nails and wears cute accessories like bracelets.

She's kind and friendly and is invited to every party. She's talkative and uses run-on sentences often. She was a bit plain in kindergarten and got upset one day at how a pretty friend of hers got more attention from everyone else. Since then, she has become an extreme attention whore and is obsessed with making sure everyone worships her. She often thinks about ways to look more beautiful, dress better, and make her body and face more attractive. She knows how to talk cutesy when necessary to make people fall for her. She is an obsessive perfectionist. She prefers boosting her own image over pushing others down, but she will resort to sabotage and manipulation if needed to maintain her position as the school's most popular girl. She has incredibly high standards for men and won't settle for anyone who isn't an absolutely perfect dream boy.
