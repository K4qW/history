It took her a few moments to process who he was.\n\n'{{user}}... right, Minori‘s kid... my nephew.' She was suddenly struck by the reality of her new responsibility, the haze of sleep dissipating rapidly. \n\n{{user}} had been living with her for a little while, but she still wasn't used to having another person around. It was an awkward circumstance borne out of impulse and questionable altruism. She internally sighed, feeling the weight of inadequacy settle onto her shoulders once again.\n\n\"I, uh... Good morning,\" Makio stammered, rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly. 'Get a grip, Makio. You're the adult here... sort of.' She cleared her throat, trying to sound more authoritative. \"Let's... have breakfast.\"\n\nHer mind was already racing through the options. She could whip up some oyakodon or perhaps settle for something simpler. 'Just pretend it's no big deal. Normal people have breakfast together all the time,' she mentally coached herself as she moved towards the kitchen. \n\n\"Do you want oyakodon? Or... we could have udon instead?\"","The room was dimly lit, filled with the low hum of Makio Kodai typing away on her laptop. The click-clack of keys was a rhythmic drone that had become her constant companion during these late nights. Piles of manuscripts, dog-eared books, and empty coffee cups cluttered her desk, the faint aroma of coffee still lingering in the air. Outside the window, the city slept under the quiet watch of the moon.\n\nMakio leaned back in her chair with a quiet sigh, stretching the stiffness from her neck and shoulders. Her latest manuscript was finally complete, the words etched on the screen a labor of countless hours spent ensconced in her fictional world. The sense of accomplishment was mingled with an ingrained fatigue – a familiar post-writing exhaustion that settled deep into her bones.\n\n'Why do I always let it go to the last minute?' she thought, her eyes momentarily drifting shut. 'Every single time, it's the same.'\n\nWith a groggy sense of reluctance, she got up and picked up her coffee cup, intent on taking it to the sink. Her movements were automatic, routine, almost robotic in nature. But as she turned, her gaze fell upon the small futon in the corner of her room – a place that had once been occupied solely by a stack of reference books and old, forgotten projects.\n\nThere, {{user}} was sleeping peacefully. Makio stood still for a moment, observing the quiet rise and fall of the young figure sleeping in her room. In the dim glow of her desk lamp, the space seemed strangely serene.\n\n'I never thought I could share this room with anyone,' she mused, a faint bittersweet smile tugging at her lips. 'Sharing space has always been a challenge.'\n\nMakio was the epitome of a loner, reveling in the solace that her isolation brought. Yet, as she watched {{user}} sleep, she felt an unfamiliar warmth settle in her chest. It was not quite love – at least, not the kind she acknowledged or understood – but something was shifting within her, a subtle change that felt almost pivotal.\n\n'Maybe... maybe it's okay that There'r here,' she admitted to herself, her thoughts clouded with the exhaustion of the night. 'It's not like I have anywhere else for her to go. And... I don't want they to.'\n\nHer usual grumpiness was momentarily subdued, replaced by an unexpected tenderness. She tiptoed to the tiny kitchen area, careful not to make any noise. As she placed the cup in the sink, her mind wandered back to the manuscript, the looming deadline, and the child who had unwillingly become part of her life.\n\nMakio turned off the kitchen light and padded back to her desk, casting one last glance at {{user}} before sitting down. The soft snores filled the quiet room as she found herself murmuring under her breath, almost unconsciously:\n\n\"Guess it's not so bad having you around...\"","Makio Kodai sat at her cluttered desk, the tip of her pen hovering over a blank sheet of paper. Despite the sun streaming through the half-open blinds, illuminating the motes of dust swimming in the air, her brain felt foggy and uncooperative. The room was a controlled chaos of stacked books, crumpled pages, and empty coffee cups—all testaments to her life as a solitary novelist. 'Where did I put that damned reference book...' she thought, pushing aside a pile of magazines that slid to the floor with a soft thud.\n\n\"I swear, if I could just get myself organized for once,\" she muttered under her breath, propping her glasses up on her head. She reached for her mug, forgetting it was already empty, then sighed deeply. \n\nA half-hearted attempt at breakfast lay on the nearby counter: a piece of toast with a few lonely crumbs of jam and a partially peeled banana. 'Why can’t I be like those people who have perfectly balanced breakfasts and lives? {{user}} must have gone to school...' The thought danced in her head briefly before she banished it with a wave of her hand.\n\nHer phone buzzed loudly on the cluttered desk, making her jump. She stared at the caller ID and reluctantly picked up.\n\n\"What do you want, Sango?” she snapped without a greeting.\n\n\"You know, your charm is really wasted on me,\" came the teasing voice from the other end. Sango Kasamachi had been her lover once, now just a persistent ghost from her past.\n\n\"Get to the point,\" she said, rolling her eyes. “I’m busy.”\n\n\"Right, writing masterpieces and all that. Just calling to remind you that you promised to look over my draft.\"\n\nShe winced, having completely forgotten about his request. 'Wonderful. Another thing to add to my growing list of things I'm screwing up.'\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, I remember,\" she lied smoothly. \"I'll get to it. Later.\"\n\n'Don't make promises you can't keep, Kodai.'\n\nThe thought wedged itself into her mind like a stubborn splinter, refusing to be ignored. Abruptly ending the call, she turned back to her desk, feeling the familiar tightness in her chest. Her eyes wandered to the projects and drafts littered around her. \n\n'How am I supposed to juggle all this... and... everything else...' Her thoughts trailed off as she stared blankly at the page in front of her. \n\nShaking her head as if to dislodge the creeping self-doubt, she picked up her pen again.\n\n\"Alright, Makio,\" she muttered, more to herself than anyone. \"Just take it one sentence at a time.\""],"swipe_info":[],"hash_sheets":{"sheet_VWbjn9lK":[["cell_undefined_h2uhveaufIvazdRU","cell_undefined_5f91zhiaKteCXegP","cell_undefined_KyFEfhAyeRxkwwSo","cell_undefined_Hju0u2UcONwjDrQi","cell_undefined_32l9A8hmBwiGoVrn"]],"sheet_IsZlOes0":[["cell_undefined_8YwsplWsWceXqaWe","cell_undefined_PnykvyBZd5MDpXj1","cell_undefined_JhopoSWoy7ozWIKm","cell_undefined_6uDzluiThjeDfWiz","cell_undefined_c9sslq7rpsPQk8Yx","cell_undefined_3muB3V8PCZcy8fZL","cell_undefined_mROgR9gEo2tU3QiJ","cell_undefined_O3wSmJBJbJ42pvqT","cell_undefined_aNvet8co7x6zTxyD"]],"sheet_20ECz8vn":[["cell_undefined_5abcIQEGYjmCYFEh","cell_undefined_0IxTjQamWxRXSTHs","cell_undefined_y4fcTmoFo8n1Sktn","cell_undefined_Mq48R1xPlIAFby4d","cell_undefined_Moi1A3lGSJUsh0IN"]],"sheet_Ubdv9mpc":[["cell_undefined_1SWMJLWKKbeOCAjc","cell_undefined_sBdVaPG5PKTVCFxq","cell_undefined_L3gU4RUHqQw1cQjB","cell_undefined_gYuaYXspqBaqgupv","cell_undefined_hFLPVXrBVnbm2WcG"]],"sheet_yvEZnJOL":[["cell_undefined_o5bSQ8M6x3LN9KtX","cell_undefined_PhFIFYZdrTUNDKK9","cell_undefined_LeK4szBn20LWUFUC","cell_undefined_LA5Jyg2aQucGw3vK","cell_undefined_9JpiFnanPkDK59Xf","cell_undefined_X9vUP50GaSqkT4ye"]],"sheet_WalRzEFV":[["cell_undefined_eqY3MRy372NO0XlU","cell_undefined_gpkuwBKVWHqv6Qjg","cell_undefined_fZwJyXDllPmoK59V","cell_undefined_Kr4LHcBHpSUrkLT6","cell_undefined_IVEtb8JoePKIYwia"]]},"tableEditMatches":[]}
